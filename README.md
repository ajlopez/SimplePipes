## Inception

This work was inspired by [Circuit](https://github.com/tatumizer/circuit) by [Tatumizer](https://github.com/tatumizer), but
it was based on my research about Go Channels and distributed applications I implemented in other technologies (see
[Channels And GoRoutines In AjSharp](http://ajlopez.wordpress.com/2009/12/30/channels-and-goroutines-in-ajsharp-part-2/),
